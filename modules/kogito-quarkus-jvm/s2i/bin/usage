This is the quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-jvm-ubi8 S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample invocation:

s2i build <binary path/URL> quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-jvm-ubi8 <application image>

Where the binary path/URL is the built artifact that you want to copy to your image.
Note that, for quarkus non Uberjar builds, you also must add the target/lib on the current directory
so the s2i build can copy it into the image.

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run <application image>
