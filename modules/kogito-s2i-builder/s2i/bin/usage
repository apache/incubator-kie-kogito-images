NATIVE_COMMANDS="For the native build, just set the NATIVE environment variable to "true" and use
the quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-runtime-native image as runtime-image.
In that way, a native build will be produced and copied to the runtime image.

Example:

$ s2i build -c /Development/project/ ${IMAGE_NAME} <application image> --env RUNTIME_TYPE=quarkus --runtime-image quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-runtime-native --env NATIVE=true"

if [[ "${JBOSS_IMAGE_NAME}" =~ "rhpam-7" ]]; then
    IMAGE_NAME="registry.redhat.io/rhpam-7/rhpam-kogito-builder-rhel8"

This is the ${IMAGE_NAME} S2I image:

Build native image based on project source either complete maven project or just set of business assets
such as processes (BPMN), rules (DRL), decisions (DMN).

To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

This image is intended only to build application binaries copied to runtime image when the build is finished.


S2I command syntax:

$ s2i build -c <source code path/URL> ${IMAGE_NAME} <application image> --runtime-image <image name>


Sample invocation:

$ s2i build -c /Development/project/ ${IMAGE_NAME} <application image> --env RUNTIME_TYPE=quarkus --runtime-image ${RUNTIME_JVM_IMAGE_NAME}

By default, it generates a non-native build. Use the ${RUNTIME_JVM_IMAGE_NAME} image as runtime-image,
in that way, a *runner.jar will be produced and copied to the runtime image.

Example:

$ s2i build -c /Development/project/ ${IMAGE_NAME} <application image> --env RUNTIME_TYPE=quarkus --runtime-image ${RUNTIME_JVM_IMAGE_NAME}

echo -n ${NATIVE_COMMANDS}

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run <application image>
