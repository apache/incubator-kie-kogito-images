This is the quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-ubi8 S2I image:

Build native image based on project source either complete maven project or just set of business assets
such as processes, rules, decisions.

To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

This image is intended to build application binaries only that are later on transfered to runtime image.


s2i build -c <source code path/URL> quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-ubi8-s2i <application image> --runtime-image <image name>

Sample invocation:

s2i build -c /Development/project/ quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-ubi8-s2i <application image> --runtime-image quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-ubi8

For non native build, just set the NATIVE environment variable to false and use the quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-quarkus-jvm-ubi8
image as runtime-image, in that way a *runner.jar will be produced and copied to the runtime image.

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run <application image>
