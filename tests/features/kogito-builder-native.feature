Feature: kogito-builder image native build tests

  Scenario: verify java cacerts and libsunec are available in the given kogito builder container.
    When container is started with command bash
    Then  file /home/kogito/ssl-libs/libsunec.so should exist
    And file /home/kogito/cacerts should exist

  Scenario: verify if the maven and graal vm settings are correct on kogito-builder image for native
    When container is started with command bash
    Then run sh -c 'echo $MAVEN_HOME' in container and immediately check its output for /usr/share/maven
    And run sh -c 'echo $MAVEN_VERSION' in container and immediately check its output for 3.6.2
    And run sh -c 'echo $JAVA_HOME' in container and immediately check its output for /usr/lib/jvm/java-11
    And run sh -c 'echo $GRAALVM_HOME' in container and immediately check its output for /usr/share/graalvm
    And run sh -c 'echo $GRAALVM_VERSION' in container and immediately check its output for 20.2.0

  Scenario: Verify if the s2i build is finished as expected using native build and runtime image
