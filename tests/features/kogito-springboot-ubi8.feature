Feature: springboot-quarkus-ubi8 feature.

  Scenario: verify if all labels are correctly set.
    Given image is built
    Then the image should contain label maintainer with value kogito <kogito@kiegroup.com>
    And the image should contain label io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url with value image:///usr/local/s2i
    And the image should contain label io.openshift.s2i.destination with value /tmp
    And the image should contain label io.openshift.expose-services with value 8080:http
    And the image should contain label io.k8s.description with value Runtime image for Kogito based on SpringBoot native image
    And the image should contain label io.k8s.display-name with value Kogito based on SpringBoot native image
    And the image should contain label io.openshift.tags with value builder,runtime,kogito,springboot
    And the image should contain label io.openshift.s2i.assemble-input-files with value /home/kogito/bin

  Scenario: verify if the java installation is correct
    When container is started with command bash
    Then run sh -c 'echo $JAVA_HOME' in container and immediately check its output for /usr/lib/jvm/java-11
    And run sh -c 'echo $JAVA_VENDOR' in container and immediately check its output for openjdk
    And run sh -c 'echo $JAVA_VERSION' in container and immediately check its output for 11

  Scenario: Verify if the binary build is finished as expected and if it is listening on the expected port
